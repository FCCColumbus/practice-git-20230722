John is Batman - it's true!  He has saved many cities, towns, cats and dogs, teams from certain peril -- the list goes on!
Some of John's setbacks include meddling kids playing on his lawn, stoplights, and people who generally suck the life out of him.  He strives to be a grumpy old man.  

Here is the stuff I put in my conference bios:
