## Chris Spencer

Chris Spencer was a carpenter and a writer for 15+ years. He found his way to programming because he loves proofreading and code loves being proofread. He was surprised to find how similar writing code is to writing a story, in the sense that coding is sort of like writing strange little poems that are capable of actually creating things as you write them. In many ways, programming feels like the natural next step in progression from storytelling.
